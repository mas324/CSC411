    "The code snippet below shows the functions for the forward pass, backward pass, and weight adjustment. The forward_pass function is straightforward. The only difference is that when creating the input to the output layer, we now need to extend it with a vector of bias terms instead of just a single bias term. It is a vector because there needs to be one bias element for each example in the minibatch. Another difference is that x is now a matrix representing a batch of training examples instead of a vector representing a single example. The code itself has not changed, but it is worth noting that the arguments to matmul are now two matrices instead of a matrix and a vector.\n",

    "In adjust_weights, we need to append a vector of bias terms (technically, a matrix where one dimension is 1) to the outputs from the hidden layer where the vector length represents the mini-batch size. We have added a for loop that loops through all the examples in the mini-batch, accumulates the deltas in the delta_matrix, and then divides by the mini-batch size. This is how we compute the average of the gradient. We then simply do the weight update just as in the previous implementation but now using this averaged matrix instead.\n"
